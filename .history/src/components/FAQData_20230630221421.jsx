        question : "How does Test Amplify work?",

        question : "Why not use a crowdsourced QA solution?",
        answer: "Crowdsourcing QA can have its place. But we've found that context is everything in testing. When we get to know your product, it makes us more effective. Our testing relationship is a partnership, and not some random fling. (And what's more, our testers go way beyond what crowdsourced testers are able to do.) We talk with your devs directly in Slack, follow up on issues, work within your release timelines, and anticipate your needs. It's a completely different experience.",

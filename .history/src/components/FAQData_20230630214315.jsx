        question : "How does Test Amplify work?",
        answer: "We assign a team to learn the ins and outs of your project, and start manually testing your app. We report bugs to your team directly and we remain available as you continue development on your project. We've formed long-term testing partnerships with clients for years. We provide ongoing support, burst capacity, and everything in between.",

        question : "Why not use a crowdsourced QA solution?",
        answer: "        Crowdsourcing QA can have its place. But we've found that context is everything in testing. When we get to know your product, it makes us more effective. Our testing relationship is a partnership, and not some random fling. (And what's more, our testers go way beyond what crowdsourced testers are able to do.) We talk with your devs directly in Slack, follow up on issues, work within your release timelines, and anticipate your needs. It's a completely different experience.
